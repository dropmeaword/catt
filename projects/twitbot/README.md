#### Interacting with Twitter
Twitter provides an API, which is a way of accessing the functionalities of a web application programmatically. In order to use the API you need an API key, which is a way of telling the Twitter API that your bot is a third-party that wants access to a particular twitter account without having to give that third party the username and password of the twitter account:

You can create a new key here:
https://apps.twitter.com/

When generating the key make sure your app has the right permissions "Read, Write access individual posts".

#### The code
To write our tweetbot we will be using the python programming language. This is already installed in your macbook. We need a python library called tweetpy that will be our programming interface to twitter. You can get the library [here](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) and the [documentation is here](http://tweepy.readthedocs.org/en/v3.2.0/).
